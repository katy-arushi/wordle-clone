### Wordle Clone

Made from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wak7iN4JZzU) tutorial from [WebDevSimplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw).

This tutorial was great! It was a great refresher of DOM manipulation, JavaScript functions and dynamically adding classes. I also learned a bit about CSS animation and data attributes in HTML.

I would like to add my own custom words, change the color scheme to something ✨pink or purple-y✨, add a logo or header above the tiles, and improve the user experience of the mobile version (right now the keyboard is too small). A bug was also mentioned in the comments of the tutorial about an issue related to when the target word has repeating letters that should be tackled.
